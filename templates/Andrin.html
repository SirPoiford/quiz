        <h2>Andrin Plattner</h2>
        <p>Andrin is like Malin and Samira in the first grade of the Gymnasium Muttenz.
        He likes this school but the school before was also nice. The only negative at that school was the french plus.
        His favourites subjects are sport, biology and maths, but it depends on the teacher.
